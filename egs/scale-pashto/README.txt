An Pashto recipe developed during the Scale 2015 workshop
(see http://hltcoe.jhu.edu/research/scale-workshops/ ) as a part of
the speech-to-text translation (STTT) system.

This recipe uses the following databases
*Lila Consortium Appen Pashto
*IARPA Babel Pashto FullLP (release IARPA-babel104b-v04.bY)
*TransTac Pashto

Most of these corpora are not publicly available (unless you/your
organization) were part of the consortium _and_ DARPA TransTac 
_and_ IARPA Babel
